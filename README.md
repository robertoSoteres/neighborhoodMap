# neighborhoodMap
Final project

## Using Google maps + knockout js
I have generated the following project in order to be able to prepare a final project for the [nanodegree de udacity de front-end](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001).

### Frameworks & libraries

I used the google maps API with al the necessary things to create the interactive map, knockout to control in a simple way the MC* part and jquery to othe things.

### How to use
1. Download the project.
2. You should open file index.html in your favorite browser and enjoy!

We used a task runner: Gulp!

### How to use Gulp
For a Getting started guide, API docs, recipes, making a plugin, etc. check out the [docs](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/README.md)!

We used this plugins: 
    1. [cleanCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-clean-css).
    2. [rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-rename).
    3. [dest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-dest).
    4. [uglify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-uglyfly).
    
    
If you want to run all the tasks, you should install all the required packages (cleanCSS, rename, dest and uglify) and after that you should open the console, write "gulp" and enter. It will run all the tasks.

Thank you!
