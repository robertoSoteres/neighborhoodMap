# neighborhoodMap
Final project

## Using Google maps + knockout js
I have generated the following project in order to be able to prepare a final project for the [nanodegree de udacity de front-end][https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001].

### Frameworks & libraries

I used the google maps API with al the necessary things to create the interactive map, knockout to control in a simple way the MC* part and jquery to othe things.

### How to use
You should open file index.html in your favorite browser or in yout mobile and enjoy!

Thanks!


Roberto Soteres.
